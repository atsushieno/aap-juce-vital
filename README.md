# Vitaloid!

It is an ongoing port of [Vital](https://github.com/mtytel/vital) to [AAP](https://github.com/atsushieno/android-audio-plugin-framework). Since any unofficial builds must be named otherwise than "Vital", I call it "Vitaloid" so far.

It runs on Android as a standalone app, just with almost not controllable UI on the small screen and probably no useful file import/export features (anything that involves file dialog).

And as an AAP it still crashes, maybe due to lack of appropriate default parameter values (debuggee vitaloid crashes on Android Studio without useful information so it's almost impossible to investigate the issue in decent way yet.
